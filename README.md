# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL Mini Project)

This project presents a detailed analysis of pizza sales using structured query language (SQL). The dataset simulates sales transactions from a fictional pizza chain. The analysis aims to uncover key insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🧠 Key SQL Concepts Used

- **JOIN** operations between multiple tables  
- Aggregate functions: **`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `FLOOR`**  
- Grouping and ordering: **`GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`**  
- Filtering: **`WHERE`, `LIMIT`**  
- Subqueries and derived tables  
- Window functions: **`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `SUM() OVER`**  
- Date and time functions: **`HOUR()`, `DATE()`**
